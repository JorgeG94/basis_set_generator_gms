# Basis set generator 

This is a sample generator that uses the basis set exchange python API to 
download an reinrpret a basis set using optimized general contractions and produces
a module with the corresponding subroutines with each one of the subroutines needed
placed in a submodule for easier compilation

Just: `python ccn-dk-get_basis.py` 

You'll need `pip install basis-set-exchange`.
